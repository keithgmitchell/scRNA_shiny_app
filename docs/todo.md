# Done or not needed

- add an option for the PC graphs 
- marker set tab with the figure Blythe/Matt had seen
- readme tab (MD)
- make the side by side (secondary gene) optional
    - going along with this Matt wanted to change the layout.. I did put the violin plot in the middle
    - not sure i can group them around the side bar layout as wanted.
