# Todo:
- readme documentation tab with the primers/library used
- change the colors from (green and red) hack the Feature plot function seurat:::function
- dont hard code the PCs only grab the first 10

# Done or not needed
## newer
- stretch out the 2nd plot
- make the docs the first tab
- layout all the way across the top
- make NA an option for the second gene (binary button)(kinda done? just did a variation of this)



## older
- ensembl gene id's symbol if available 
- add an option for the PC graphs 
- marker set tab with the figure Blythe/Matt had seen
- readme tab (MD)
- make the side by side (secondary gene) optional
    - going along with this Matt wanted to change the layout.. I did put the violin plot in the middle
    - not sure i can group them around the side bar layout as wanted. 
    

# Not sure how to do it
- make the default NA

# Questions
- is it ok to use experiment merged for everything (has more groupings) OK
